# PxGrid-Node
This is an under-development Node.js module for interacting with Cisco PxGrid 2.0 that uses REST and WebSockets along with a STOMP-based messaging protocol. You can read more about it [on Cisco DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/pxgrid/#!introduction-to-pxgrid-2-0).

It has great performance improvements over using Cisco ISE's standard REST API, as well as the obvious benefits that come with a subscribe/publish model over a general pull model.

## Documentation
The short answer is - there isn't any. I will work on at least getting a quick start style write up here at some point when I expect this to be fully usable; however, for now you'll have to decipher my random [examples](examples/) to get started.

## **Warning**: use at your own risk and/or peril.
This is not a fully fletched, fully tested, fully functional, fully professional, or fully anything else module. I'm still working on getting it to a better state where I'm comfortable saying it is likely reliable; however, it's not there, yet, and I have only done limited testing for functionality testing.

I have not integrated it into any projects to come across, and therefore fix, any real issues that may arise.

Nevertheless, it is here for your consumption and harsh ridicule.
